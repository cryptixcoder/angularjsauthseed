{"body":"Angular JS Auth Seed\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is a modified version of the AngularJS seed project that includes a login / authentication system. It includes 3 basic demo pages (create account, login, protected content), as well as basic PHP server-side code for the app.\r\n\r\nOn default, when a page loads, the app asks the server if the user is logged in, so that any non-login or create page will be protected. You can also configure the system to only require a login when the app is rejected sensitive content due the the user not being logged in.\r\n\r\nHow It Works\r\n==============\r\nThe system works by intercepting 401 Not Authorized responses from the server (in for example a $http query). Any 401 Not Authorized response will trigger a rerender of the login screen. The page the user attempted to access when given the 401 response is saved, and returned to once authentication is attained again.  \r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n==============\r\nThis is used like the normal [AngularJS Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). Clone it into a directory and host it with a PHP/Mysql server. Use the .sql file to create the basic database structure. Configure the system for your database in conn_mysql.php\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n===========\r\nPHP for default server-side\r\n\r\nMySql for default database\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n======\r\nkidovate or Christian Stewart, 2013\r\n\r\nUnlicense\r\n=========\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
