        <h1>Angular JS Auth Seed</h1>

<p>This is a modified version of the AngularJS seed project that includes a login / authentication system. It includes 3 basic demo pages (create account, login, protected content), as well as basic PHP server-side code for the app.</p>

<p>On default, when a page loads, the app asks the server if the user is logged in, so that any non-login or create page will be protected. You can also configure the system to only require a login when the app is rejected sensitive content due the the user not being logged in.</p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>The system works by intercepting 401 Not Authorized responses from the server (in for example a $http query). Any 401 Not Authorized response will trigger a rerender of the login screen. The page the user attempted to access when given the 401 response is saved, and returned to once authentication is attained again.  </p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This is used like the normal <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">AngularJS Seed</a>. Clone it into a directory and host it with a PHP/Mysql server. Use the .sql file to create the basic database structure. Configure the system for your database in conn_mysql.php</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>PHP for default server-side</p>

<p>MySql for default database</p>
